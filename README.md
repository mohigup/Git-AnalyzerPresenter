# Git-AnalyzerPresenter

Github Repo Visualizer and Presenter (gitVIZ))is web based application build on M.E.A.N architecture. It aims to connect developers, project managers, business analysts with a public Git repository information such git repo activity, commits, issues, pull requests via Charts and Graphs allowing more analysis over repository that would be resourceful for developers/teams to visualise progress of product development. 

Further, it allows users to see release details of any Git Repo.

Moreover, academics often find themselves copying a lot of code from a repository per commit into Powerpoint during training session/classes. There is considerable amount of manual effort and time invested. So, the project opens paths to solve this problem by retrieving upt 600 commits for a given repository and generating a presentation dynamically. The presentation will have a page for each commit along with changed the files

In summary, gitVIZ will be a great tool for developers and academics allowing easier data analysis and on-the-fly presentation for Git Repo.
